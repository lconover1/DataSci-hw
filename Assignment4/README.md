# Homework 4
The goal of this homework is to solidify data wrangling skills in the grey area between data aggregation and data reshaping. This includes skills such as:
* Filtering rows and selecting variables
* Modifying existing variables and creating new ones
* Grouping rows of a data frame and summarizing or mutating within the group
* Reshaping a data frame
* Adding new information into a data frame via a joining

It mostly uses the 'gapminder' dataset and a wedding list dataset from the class website.
