## Overview

The goal is to manipulate and explore a dataset with the `dplyr` package, 
complemented by visualizations made with `ggplot2`. You can think of this as a 
deeper version of Homework 02.

## Assignment

Pick _*three*_ of the tasks below, and, for each selected task, produce: 

- a tibble, using `dplyr` as your data manipulation tool;
- an accompanying plot of data from the tibble, using `ggplot2` as your visualization tool; and
- some dialogue about what your tables/figures show (doesn't have to be much).
  - The idea is to structure your assignment like it's an actual report someone
    might read.

### Task Option 3

Work with `gapminder`. Look at the spread/variability of GDP per capita within 
the continents.
  
_Tibble:_
  

continent     Minimum     Maximum       Range
----------  ---------  ----------  ----------
Africa         241.17    21951.21    21710.04
Americas      1201.64    42951.65    41750.01
Asia           331.00   113523.13   113192.13
Europe         973.53    49357.19    48383.66
Oceania      10039.60    34435.37    24395.77

<!-- Plotting GDP on a log scale might be better -->

_Dialogue:_
  
As you can see in the graphs above, every continent has a right-tailed distribution of GDP per capita.  Although most continents have a range across the years between 20,000 and 50,000, Asia has the greatest spread with a range over 113,000.

  
### Task Option 7

Work with `psych::bfi`. Compute composite scores for the five Big Five scores, 
including both person-mean scores and person-sd scores. Describe the 
distributions of the different personality variables.
 
_Tibble:_

```r
composite_bfi<-psych::bfi %>% 
  rownames_to_column(var = "id") %>% 
  as_tibble() %>%
  group_by(id) %>% # rowwise() will also work
  mutate(A_mean = mean(c(A1, A2, A3, A4, A5),na.rm = TRUE), 
         A_sd = sd(c(A1, A2, A3, A4, A5),na.rm = TRUE), 
         C_mean = mean(c(C1, C2, C3, C4, C5),na.rm = TRUE), 
         C_sd = sd(c(C1, C2, C3, C4, C5),na.rm = TRUE), 
         E_mean = mean(c(E1, E2, E3, E4, E5),na.rm = TRUE), 
         E_sd = sd(c(E1, E2, E3, E4, E5),na.rm = TRUE), 
         N_mean = mean(c(N1, N2, N3, N4, N5),na.rm = TRUE), 
         N_sd = sd(c(N1, N2, N3, N4, N5),na.rm = TRUE), 
         O_mean = mean(c(O1, O2, O3, O4, O5),na.rm = TRUE), 
         O_sd = sd(c(O1, O2, O3, O4, O5),na.rm = TRUE)) %>% # Best to break this up into multiple lines like I did here.
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(id,gender,education,age,A_mean,A_sd,C_mean,C_sd,E_mean,E_sd,N_mean,N_sd,O_mean,O_sd) %>% 
  print()
```

```
## # A tibble: 2,800 x 14

##  9 61630      1         1    19    3.8 1.30     4.8 1.30    3.75 0.957    3.6
## 10 61633      2        NA    17    4.8 1.64     4   2.35    3.6  1.52     4.2
## # ... with 2,790 more rows, and 3 more variables: N_sd <dbl>, O_mean <dbl>,
## #   O_sd <dbl>
```

_Dialogue:_
  
Although individuals' average scores of three of the Big 5 traits (Openness, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness) have similar peaks and ranges, the average scores for Neuroticism form a much flatter distribution.
  
### Task Option 9

Work with `psych::bfi`. Using the composite scores from Task 7, explore how age
is related to the different personality variables. Does personality appear to 
change for different ages?
  
_Tibble:_

_Dialogue:_
  
As can be seen in the plots above, age is uncorrelated with average score on any of the Big 5 personality traits.
