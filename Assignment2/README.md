1. Exercise 1
   1.1. 4/9 
     - Your year filter doesn't work work. `==` will compare each element of `year`
       to each element of your comparison (`1971`, `1972`, `1973`, etc.) one at 
       a time. You should use `%in%` instead.

   2.1. Accuracy: 10/10
   2.2. Reasoning: 10/10
4. Bonus 1 0/+2
  - The problem with the code is the use of `==`, which doesn't filter correctly
    (it alternates between comparing each element to either Rwanda _or_ Afghanistan,
    rather than comparing each element to _both_).
5. Bonus 2 +1/+1
   
**Total: ** 94/100
