## About me:  
Hello!  
My name is Laura, and I'm a doctoral candidate in USF's Communication Sciences and Disorders department.  I study under Dr. Ruth Bahr, primarily investigating methods of speech perception and phonological categorization models.  I'm also interested in other levels of spoken and gestural languages, and a lot of my work tends to match up with a cognitive psychology perspective.
